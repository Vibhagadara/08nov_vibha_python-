[1]what is software? 
-> -software is a set of insructions,data or programs used to operate computer and execute specific tasks.
   -it is the oppesite of hardware,which describe the physical aspects of a computer.
   -software is a generic term used to refer to application,scripts and programs that run on a device.
   -it can be thought of as the variable part of a computer,while hardware is the invariable part.

   -The two main categories of software are:
      1)application software:-the most common type of sotware,application software is a computer software package that 
                              performs a specific function for a user,or in some cases,for another application.

      2)system software:-these software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware.system 
                         software coordinates the activities and functions of the hardware and functions of the hardware and 
                         software.
 
      3)driver software:-also known as device drivers,this software is often considered a type of system software.device
                         drivers control th devices and peripherals connected to a computer,enabling them to perform their 
                         specific tasks.
                         
      4)middleware software:-the term middleware describes software that mediates between aplliction and system software
                             or between teo differant kinds of application software.

      5)programming software:-computer programmers use progamming software to write code.programming software and programming 
                              tools enable developers to develop,write test and debug other software programs.
   
   
[2]what are the types of application?
-> -an application is a program that runs on a computer,mobile phone/teblet,or thougha browser.
   -although applications are no different from computer programs, this term is usually used to refer to simplified programs
    intended for the average user.
    
   -there are three types of applications:
      1)computer appliction:-that are located on the desktop are designed to work eith a keyboard,mouse,and full-fledged 
                             moniter,so they are more advanced and more conveninet  to manage.

      2)mobile application:-are esier than computer application;they are designed to work on a small display using your
                            fingers.
 
      3)inyternet(web)applications:-reqire constant internet access to exchange information.they can be both computer and mobile.


[3]what is programing?
-> -in computer science fields,the word programs characterizes what a computer actually does and this process is konwn as programming.
   -we can also define the term programming as it is the process that models or structure the set of instructions that instruct the
    machine hoe to perform a task and what to perform.
   -it can be done using a verity of programming languages such as 
         c
         c++
         c#
         python 
         java 

[4]what is python?
-> -python is an interpreted,object-oriented,high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
   -its high-level built in data structures,combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding,make if very attractive for 
    rapid application development.
   -python supports modules and pakages,which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
   -the python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all
    major platforms,and can be freely distributed.
